# OHAI Prototope!

A test project for getting started using [prototope](https://github.com/khan/prototope).

## getting started

**You'll need Xcode 6.3 to run Prototope!**

Make sure to use the recursive option on clone to auto init all submodules. This
will pull in both prototope and pop (and allow your environment to build).

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/khan/ohaiprototope

If you have already cloned the repository (without the recursive option), run
the following from inside the project directory to do the same.

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive


### license

this project (but not its submodules) is released under an [MIT License]() (i'm not really sure how that works considering that lion's share of this project is cribbing from default xcode templates, but i mean, that's just where we've arrived now, isn't it). That basically means you should rename it if you release it. I mean, with a name like ohai prototope, you probably want to rename it, even if you just call it something like HowdyPrototaupe.
