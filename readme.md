# OHAI Prototope!

A test project for getting started using [prototope](https://github.com/khan/prototope)

## getting started

Once you clone this project, you need to get all the submodules working correctly. To do that, run:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

this will pull in both prototope and pop (and allow your environment to build)

### license

this project (but not its submodules) is released under an [MIT License]() (i'm not really sure how that works considering that lion's share of this project is cribbing from default xcode templates, but i mean, that's just where we've arrived now, isn't it). That basically means you should rename it if you release it. I mean, with a name like ohai prototope, you probably want to rename it, even if you just call it something like HowdyPrototaupe.
